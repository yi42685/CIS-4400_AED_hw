**Information Architecture Description** 
I am doing OLAP to analyze if there are enough of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) provided for each area in NYC. Government department employee, supplier and stakeholder will have the access of the data. The data is important to make BI solutions about NYC residentsâ€™ public health.

My first stage is to gather data from New York City Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Inventory, then clean, reformat, transform, and load them to data warehouse. The second stage will be data franchising, which I will filter and subset the data, restructure, aggregate and store them into three different data marts. When I finished this process, the data is ready to be use for OLAP to do business analysis/reports/data visualization etc.
